# Garrett Learns Go

Each file is a concept or example of something, with test cases.

Many examples are built from [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/) or [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests), but modified for my understanding.

To run a program:
```
go run program.go
```

To run the tests:
```
go test
```

To build a binary and run:
```
go build program.go
./program
```
